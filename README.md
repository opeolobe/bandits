This is the code used to implement the solutions of Assignment 1 for Reinforcement Learning.

The solution is in two parts: Stationary bandit and Non-stationary bandit

StationaryBandit folder contains the codes for the stationary problem
NonStationaryBandit folder contains the codes for the non-stationary problem

For each case:

            i. the algorithms folder contains the algorithms used

            ii. the pilot runs folder contains the tuning of each algorithms using pilot runs

            iii. the main_testbed.ipynb contains the implementation of the algorithms for comparison.
            

To get the performance of the algorithms for each case study of the bandit problem:

                run the main_testbed.ipynb for the selected category
